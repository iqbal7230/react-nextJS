## React-hooks and Context API Assignment


### Assignment Questions:
- Create a component that shows different content based on whether the user is logged in or not (e.g., "Welcome back" or "Please log in"). Use a state hook to toggle the logged-in state and update the UI accordingly.
- Create a simple ThemeContext that toggles between light and dark themes. Implement a ThemeProvider that supplies the current theme, and a ThemeToggler component that switches between themes. Make sure that the theme changes dynamically in child components.
- Create a UserContext that holds information about the logged-in user (e.g., name and email). Create a UserProfile component that displays the user’s information, and a Login component that updates the user’s data via context when the user logs in.
